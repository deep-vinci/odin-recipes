    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These baked samosas have all the flavor and heartiness without frying. Although this is an easier, healthier version, they taste just as delicious as fried samosas. Serve warm, plain, or with chutney.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup boiled and mashed potatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup peas</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>    \
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the all-purpose flour, vegetable oil, and salt. Add water gradually and knead into a firm dough. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li>
        <li>Add peas and saut√© for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Add mashed potatoes, garam masala, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well and cook for 2-3 minutes. Let the filling cool.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into small balls. Roll each ball into a circle and cut it into two halves.</li>
        <li>Take one half, wet its edges with water, and form a cone shape.</li>
        <li>Fill the cone with the potato-pea mixture and seal the edges carefully.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process for all samosas.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan for deep frying.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is hot, fry the samosas until they turn golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Remove from oil and drain excess oil on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Your delicious samosas are ready to be served with chutney or sauce!</li>
    </ol>
